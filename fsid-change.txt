BTRFS Metadata UUID  (FSID change) feature
SCOPE
==================================
The most important requirement for this feature is to ensure that while FSID
change is in progress a sudden power loss won’t lead to unrecoverable
filesystem upon next boot. This document presents analysis of the failure modes
and their automatic handling inside the kernel.

This analysis looks at only the use case when a FSID is initiated on a regular
btrfs filesystem (ie. one that is not a clone of an existing btrfs filesystem). 

Implementation
===============================================

Since btrfs cannot guarantee that superblock writes can occur atomically across
multiple devices it’s important to work around this deficiency. The proposal
set forth in this document is to introduce 2 flags in the btrfs super: 
IP (IN PROGRESS) - it signals that FSID is in progress it’s purposes will be
 explained later

C (Complete) - this flag will signal that filesystem change has already been
 completed.

All things considered I envision the following sequence of operations:

	1. The IP flag is set in transaction X and applied to all disks. 
	2. Then in transaction X+1 the C flag (this will be an incompat bit) will be set,
	   current FSID will be copied to the metadata_uuid field and a new FSID is going
	   to replace the current fsid, at this point the operation is considered complete. 

Power loss can happen anytime before, during or after either of trans X or
 trans X+1. Let’s look the failures in each of those cases: 

	1. Failure before transaction X is committed - not a problem since nothing is
	committed on disk, user just has to restart operations via btrfstune

	2. Failure during transaction X - this means that transaction X will be
	 persisted on number of N-out-of-M (N < M) disks for a filesystem consisting
	 of M disks. This will in essence create 2 partitions P and Q, where disks
 	 in P will have the IP flag and disks in Q won’t and the super block
	 generation of disks in P will be greater than the one in disks in Q. Since
	 disks in btrfs are scanned arbitrarily either disks from P or Q can be
	 scanned first hence create the initial fs_devices structure to represent
	 the filesystem. This needs to be handled.

		2.1 Let’s consider the first case where a disk from partition P is
		scanned first. In this case the scan code will detect that IP is set 
		but since existing FSID is not changed so the fs_devices struct will be
		created with the old FSID identifying the filesystem. Then all other 
		disks in P that are scanned will follow the same logic and if they 
		already detect an fs_devices struct will just be added to it. Also 
		their IP flags will be cleared upon next transaction commit. Following
		this, if a disk from partition Q are scanned they will just find the
	 	existing fs_devices  and will be added to it and the IP flag will be
		cleared on mount. Additionally fs_devices created will be marked as
		having been created from disks with the IP flag set. This will be
		required in order to handle case 4.2 (see below). 

		2.2 The second case to consider is a disk from partition Q being
		scanned first. In this case fs_devices will be created as usual (using
		the unchanged FSID) then all other Q disks will be added to this
		fs_devices and their IP flag is going to be cleared. On the other hand
		all disks from partition P will detect their IP flag and since FSID is 
		not changed they can just scan existing fs_devices for one which matches
		their FSID. One important thing to heed is that during mount btrfs’ 
		mount code always users the superblock from the device with the highest
		generation. Disk in P will have a higher generation number as such when
		a filesystem is mounted a disk in set P will be used. In order to 
		preserve consistency the IP flag must be cleared. 

	3. Failure after transaction X/before transaction X+1 - this will be handled
	the same way as in case 2, i.e IP flag will be cleared on mount and the
	filesystem will be created with the unchanged FSID.

	4. Failure during transaction x + 1. When such a failure happens the
	filesystem in question will be partitioned in two sets P and Q. Where P
	would have the C flag and a new value for fsid written to it as well as the
	old FSID value written in the ‘metadata_uuid’ field. In contrast Q would
	have just the old fsid and the IP flag, also the superblock’s generation 
	number of disks in P will be higher than those in Q. Again two cases needs
	to be handled:

		4.1 The first one is a disk from partition P being scanned initially.
		This means that fs_devices will be created with differing
		fsid/metadata_uuid values. Subsequently, when other disks from P are scanned they will just
		be added as normally. The interesting case is when a disk from partition
		Q are scanned. In this case the code should see that the superblock in
 		question has the IP flag set and at the same time will see that there
		is already a fs_devices struct which has differing metadata/fsid members
		AND the metadata_uuid matches that of FSID in disk in Q. In this case
 		the disk will be added to the filesystem, same logic applies to rest
 		of disks in partition Q upon next transaction commit their SB will be
 		overwritten with the correct information. 

		4.2 Disks in Q are handled the same way as in scenario 2.1. The main
		difference is how disks in P are handled. When such disks are scanned
		they will have differing metadata/fsid uuid, however they will detect
		that an fs_devices exist such that the metadata of the disk matches the
		metadata/fsid of the fs_devices AND the IP flag is set in fs_device
		indicating that it was created from a superblock that had the IP flag
		set. This will be an indication to the scanning code that it needs to
		add the disk, additionally since disks in P will have a higher
		superblock generation number than disk in Q upon adding such a disk to
		a fs_devices it needs to overwrite the fsid/metadata details, since
		upon mount a disk in P will be used. 

	5. Failure after transaction X + 1 - the filesystem is already changed so
	no need to do special handling

	6. It is possible that there exists such a super block that has both IP and
	C flags set. This can occur in situation where a disk has undergone a
 	successful metadata uuid change so it has the correct C flag set. When a
	subsequent FSID is initiated on such a fs the IP flag will be set as part
	of the new operation. During a failure of transaction X then we can end up 
	with disks comprising this filesystem partitioned in two sets P and Q.
	Disks in P will have both C and IP flags set and disks in Q will have only
	C flag and their fsid will be different than that of disks in Q. Disks in
	both partition will have identical metadata_uuid. The 2 cases shall be
	handled as follows:

		6.1 When a disk in P comes up it should scan the existing registered
		fs_devices for one which has differing fsid/metadata_uuid AND whose
		metadata uuid is equal to that of the disk and should join them. If none
		such is found then a new fs_devices should be created with the IP flag
		set. Subsequently as disks in Q come in they should scan for such an
		fs_device that has the IP flag set, whose metadata_uuid equal that of
		the scanned disk and whose fsid/metadat_uuid members differ. This will
		be a sign that this disk must be joined in the respective fs_devices
		and must also replace the fsid/metadata_uuid in struct btrfs_fs_devices
		to its own values. 

		6.2 When a disk in Q is scanned first, it will create fs_devices as
		usual. Then as disks from P appear they will scan the existing
		fs_devices for one with a matching metadata_uuid and a differing
		metdata_uuid/fsid in the fs_devices and should join that fs_devices
		collections.
