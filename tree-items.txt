Tree items
==========

Data is held in the various b-trees in the form of items. Each items has a
custom structure dictated based on its purpose. Items are indexed by keys and
the key for each respective item has custom meanings of its 3 data members.
[refer to table below for mappings from keys to items and the meaning of each
respective field]

Keys
----

As explaiend in [trees.txt] there is a generic btrfs_item struct which maps
to the specific btrfs_*_item structs. The table below lists the various data
that the embedded btrfs_key in btrfs_item hold for each item type.


ROOT item
---------

Every tree in BTRFS is represented by a root item in the root tree. Those tree
can either be one of the default tree as described in trees.txt or a file tree,
which represents a btrfs subvolume.

Key:
btrfs_key.objectid = either one of the well defined BTRFS_*_TREE_OBJECTID
defines, if one of the main metadata tree, or the numerical id of the subvolume,
this root representes.
btrfs_key.type = BTRFS_ROOT_ITEM_KEY
btrfs_key.offset = either 0 if objectid is one of the BTRFS_*_TREE_OBJECTID
defines or if a subvolume and not a snapshot, or if a snapshot the transaction
id when this snapshot was created.

Item data:

struct btrfs_root_item {
		/* Inode which represents the root */
        struct btrfs_inode_item inode;

		/* Transaction id when this root item was created */
        __le64 generation;

		/* For file tree BTRFS_FIRST_FREE_OBJECTID or 0 otherwise */
        __le64 root_dirid;

		/* disk offset in bytes for the root node of the tree */
        __le64 bytenr;

		/* always 0 (unused) */
        __le64 byte_limit;

		/* Counts the number of bytes tree blocks belonging to this root take (unused) */
        __le64 bytes_used;

		/* transid of the last transaction that created a snapshot of this tree */
        __le64 last_snapshot;

		/* BTRFS_ROOT_SUBVOL_RDONLY - if this is a read-only subvolume
         * BTRFS_ROOT_SUBVOL_DEAD - [internal, in-memory only]
         */
        __le64 flags;

		/* Can take either 0 or 1 */
        __le32 refs;

		/* Contains key of last dropped item during subvolume removal or relocation.
		 *  Zeroed otherwise.
		 */
        struct btrfs_disk_key drop_progress;

		/* The tree level of the node described in drop_progress. */
        __u8 drop_level;

		/* The height of the tree rooted at bytenr. */
        __u8 level;

        /*
         * The following fields appear after subvol_uuids+subvol_times
         * were introduced.
         */

		/* If equal to generation, indicates validity of the following fields.
		 * If the root is modified using an older kernel, this field and generation will
		 * become out of sync.
		 */
        __le64 generation_v2;

		/* the uuid of the filesystem */
        __u8 uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];

		/* uuid of the parent */
        __u8 parent_uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];

		/* the received uuid */
        __u8 received_uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];

		/* transaction id when an inode changes */
        __le64 ctransid;

		/* transaction id when this tree was created */
        __le64 otransid;

		/* transaction id when this volume was sent, non-zero for sent subvol */
        __le64 stransid;

		/* transaction id when this volume was received */
        __le64 rtransid;

		/* Time stamps for the above types of transaction id */
        struct btrfs_timespec ctime;
        struct btrfs_timespec otime;
        struct btrfs_timespec stime;
        struct btrfs_timespec rtime;

		/* Reserved for future use */
        __le64 reserved[8];
}


ROOT REF item
-------------

ROOT_REF items are created when either a snapshot or a subvolume is created.
Their purpose is to allow for quick identification of the parent of either a
subvolume or a snapshot. This item is used to represent both a forward
reference (from parent -> child) or a back reference (child -> parent). On
every subvol creation there are 2 such items cread (one for backref and one
for forward ref).  Forward refs allows for quickly identfitying the locations
in a directory where subvolumes are rooted. This can be useful e.g. recursive
snapshotting. Root back refs allows to recover lost snapshots. The body of
this item represents information about the direntry of the newly created
subvolume.

Key:
key.objectid = if BTRFS_ROOT_REF_KEY: id of the subvolume of the parent
If BTRFS_ROOT_BACKREF_KEY: id of newly created subvolume or snapshot.

key.type = BTRFS_ROOT_REF_KEY or BTRFS_ROOT_BACKREF_KEY

key.offset = if BTRFS_ROOT_REF_KEY: id of newly created subvolume or snapshot.
if BTRFS_ROOT_BACKREF_KEY: id of the subvolume of the parent

struct btrfs_root_ref {
		/* Inode of the parent directory of the dir entry */
        __le64 dirid;
		/* the directory index this dir entry has in the parent */
        __le64 sequence;
		/* Length of the directory entry referencing the root*/
        __le16 name_len;
		/* Actual name string follows */
}


INODE ITEM
----------

This structure contains the information typically associated with a UNIX-style
inode's stat(2) data.

Key:
btrfs_key.type = BTRFS_INODE_ITEM_KEY [0x1]
btrfs_key.objectid = inode number
btrfs_key.offset = 0
Type of data item: struct btrfs_inode_item

Item data:

struct btrfs_inode_item {
        __le64 generation; /* nfs style generation number, essentially transid when the inode was created */
        __le64 transid;    /* transid that last touched this inode */
        __le64 size;       /* size of file in bytes */
        __le64 nbytes;     /* Size allocated to this file in bytes, 0 for dirs, Sum of all 'offset' fields for EXTENT_DATA items */
        __le64 block_group; /* unused for ordinary inodes, otherwise contains the byte offset of blockgroup when used as a freespace inode /*
        __le32 nlink; /* stat.st_nlink, count of INODE_REF items entries for the inode, always set to 1 if this item is found outside of the file tree */
        __le32 uid;
        __le32 gid;
        __le32 mode;
        __le64 rdev;
        __le64 flags; /* Various flags of the indoe, see below */

        __le64 sequence; /* Sequence number used for NFS compatibility. Initialized to 0 and incremented each time mtime value is changed. */

        __le64 reserved[4]; /* Reserved for future use */
        struct btrfs_timespec atime;
        struct btrfs_timespec ctime;
        struct btrfs_timespec mtime;
        struct btrfs_timespec otime; /* Timestamp of inode creation */
}

Possible flags are:

* BTRFS_INODE_NODATASUM - Don't perform checksum operations on this inode
* BTRFS_INODE_NODATACOW - Don't perform CoW for data extents on this inode,
  when the reference count is 1.
* BTRFS_INODE_READONLY - This is a special-purpose flag used only by the
  convert code. It makes the inode readonly but deletable
* BTRFS_INODE_NOCOMPRESS - Do not compress this inode. This flag may be
  changed by the kernel as compression ratios change. If the compression ratio
  for data associated with an inode becomes undesirable, this flag will be
  set. It may be cleared if the data changes and the compression ratio is
  favorable again.
* BTRFS_INODE_PREALLOC - Inode contains preallocated extents. This instructs
  the kernel to attempt to avoid CoWing those extents.
* BTRFS_INODE_SYNC - Operations on this inode will be performed synchronously.
* BTRFS_INODE_IMMUTABLE - Inode is read-only regardless of UNIX permissions or
  ownership. Attempts to modify this inode will result in EPERM being returned
  to the user.
* BTRFS_INODE_APPEND - This inode is append-only.
* BTRFS_INODE_NODUMP - This inode is not a candidate for dumping using the
  dump(8) program. [Accepted but not implemented]
* BTRFS_INODE_NOATIME - Do not update atime when this inode is accessed.
* BTRFS_INODE_DIRSYNC - Operations on directory operations will be performed
  synchronously.
* BTRFS_INODE_COMPRESS - Compression is enabled on this inode.


CHUNK_ITEM
----------

The chunk items are used to describe the logical address space of the backing
store. They are divided into data and metadata chunk items. When metadata has
to be written first a chunk item with enough freespace has to be found and
then it's used to write data. Similarly, when data is to be written a data
chunk item is located and used.

Key:
key.type = BTRFS_CHUNK_ITEM_KEY
key.objectid = BTRFS_FIRST_CHUNK_TREE_OBJECTID
key.offset = starting logical address of the chunk.

struct btrfs_chunk {
        /* size of this chunk in bytes */
        __le64 length;

        /* objectid of the root referencing this chunk. Always set to EXTENT_ROOT */
        __le64 owner;

        /* Replication stripe length */
        __le64 stripe_len;

		/* Same flags as those in btrfs_block_group_item */
        __le64 type;

        /* optimal io alignment for this chunk */
        __le32 io_align;

        /* optimal io width for this chunk */
        __le32 io_width;

        /* minimal io size for this chunk */
        __le32 sector_size;

        /* 2^16 stripes is quite a lot, a second limit is the size of a single
         * item in the btree
         */
        __le16 num_stripes;

        /* Number of replication sub stripes (Apply only to RAID10*/
        __le16 sub_stripes;

		/* The first of one or more stripes which map to device extents, this
		 * is the first member of an array
		 */
        struct btrfs_stripe stripe;

        /* additional stripes go here */
}

Stripes essentially map a logical (chunk) address to a physical (device)
address. For every stripe in a chunk there is going to be a device extent item
allocated for the respective device

struct btrfs_stripe {
		/* Id of device this stripe applies to */
        __le64 devid;
		/* Starting offset on the physical disk for this stripe */
        __le64 offset;
		/* UUID of device */
        __u8 dev_uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];
}


DEVICE item
-----------

Each constituent device in a btrfs filesystem is represented by a DEVICE item.
It described various characteristics of the underlying physical device such as
sector size, io alignment, speeds and size.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_DEV_ITEMS_OBJECTID
key.type = BTRFS_DEV_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = device id, incrementally increasing ids, starting at 1


struct btrfs_dev_item {
        /* the internal btrfs device id */
        __le64 devid;

        /* size of the device */
        __le64 total_bytes;

        /* bytes used */
        __le64 bytes_used;

        /* optimal io alignment for this device */
        __le32 io_align;

        /* optimal io width for this device */
        __le32 io_width;

        /* minimal io size for this device */
        __le32 sector_size;

        /* type and info about this device */
        __le64 type;

        /* expected generation for this device */
        __le64 generation;

        /*
         * starting byte of this partition on the device,
         * to allow for stripe alignment in the future
         */
        __le64 start_offset;

        /* grouping information for allocation decisions */
        __le32 dev_group;

        /* seek speed 0-100 where 100 is fastest */
        __u8 seek_speed;

        /* bandwidth 0-100 where 100 is fastest */
        __u8 bandwidth;

        /* btrfs generated uuid for this device */
        __u8 uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];

        /* uuid of FS who owns this device */
        __u8 fsid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];
}


DEVICE EXTENT item
------------------

Device extent items represent allocated space on every physical disk. This
structure is used to map physical extents on an individual backing device to a
chunk. This extent may be the only one for a particular chunk or one of
several.

Key:
key.objectid = device id of the device this extent is allocated from
key.type = BTRFS_DEV_EXTENT_KEY
key.offset = address where this extent begins on disk

struct btrfs_dev_extent {
		/* Object id of the chunk tree which own this extent, always
         * BTRFS_CHUNK_TREE_OBJECTID
         */
        __le64 chunk_tree;
		/* Object id of the chunk item which own this extent, always
		 *  BTRFS_FIRST_CHUNK_TREE_OBJECTID
         */
        __le64 chunk_objectid;
		/* Offset of the CHUNK_ITEM that references this extent. */
        __le64 chunk_offset;
		/* length of this extent in bytes */
        __le64 length;
		/* uuid of chunk tree, redundant way to check ownership */
        __u8 chunk_tree_uuid[BTRFS_UUID_SIZE];
}


DEVICE STATS item
-----------------

Every constituent device of a btrfs partition has a DEVICE STATS items associated
with. It stores IO stats in the device tree. The body of the item is a simple
array of 64 bit counters.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_DEV_STATS_OBJECTID
key.type = BTRFS_PERSISTENT_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = device id

struct btrfs_dev_stats_item {
        /* Array of available statistics */
        __le64 values[BTRFS_DEV_STAT_VALUES_MAX];
}

The available counterid are defined by the following enum:

enum btrfs_dev_stat_values {
        /* disk I/O failure stats */
        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_WRITE_ERRS, /* EIO or EREMOTEIO from lower layers */
        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_READ_ERRS, /* EIO or EREMOTEIO from lower layers */
        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_FLUSH_ERRS, /* EIO or EREMOTEIO from lower layers */

        /* stats for indirect indications for I/O failures */
        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_CORRUPTION_ERRS, /* checksum error, bytenr error or
                                         * contents is illegal: this is an
                                         * indication that the block was damaged
                                         * during read or write, or written to
                                         * wrong location or read from wrong
                                         * location */
        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_GENERATION_ERRS, /* an indication that blocks have not
                                         * been written */

        BTRFS_DEV_STAT_VALUES_MAX
};


DEV REPLACE item
----------------

When dev replace is initiated a dev replace item is inserted into the device
tree. It describes the state of a device replace operation. When a filesystem
is being mounted btrfs' code will check to see if such an item exists and
populate its in-memory state with the values found in the item. There can ever
be at most one such item in the device tree.

Key:
key.objectid = 0
key.type = BTRFS_DEV_REPLACE_KEY
key.offset = 0

struct btrfs_dev_replace_item {
		/* Id of the device we are replacing */
        __le64 src_devid;
        __le64 cursor_left;
        __le64 cursor_right;
        __le64 cont_reading_from_srcdev_mode;

		/* Can be one of :
		 * BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_NEVER_STARTED - replace never initiated.
		 * BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_STARTED - replace is running
		 * BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_FINISHED - replace has finished
		 * BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_CANCELED - replace as been cancelled.
		 * BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_STATE_SUSPENDED - replace has been suspended
		/*
        __le64 replace_state;
		/* Time replace was initiated */
        __le64 time_started;
		/* Time replace stopped, either due to cancellation or finishing */
        __le64 time_stopped;
		/* Write errors encountered while replacing device */
        __le64 num_write_errors;
		/* Uncorrectable read errors encountered while replacing device */
        __le64 num_uncorrectable_read_errors;
}


BLOCK GROUP item
----------------

While the extent tree defines the address space used for extent allocations
for the entire file system, block groups allocate and define the parameters
within that space. Every extent item or metadata item that describes an extent
in use by the file system is apportioned from allocated block groups. Each
block group can represent space used for system objects (e.g. the chunk tree
and primary super block), metadata trees and items, or data extents. It is
possible to combine metadata and data allocations within a single block group,
though it is not recommended. This mixed allocation policy is typically only
seen on filesystems smaller than approximately 10 GiB in size.

Key:
key.type = BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_ITEM_KEY
key.objectid = starting logical address of chunk
key.offset = size of chunk

struct btrfs_block_group_item {
		/* Bytes used from this block group */
        __le64 used;
		/* The object id of the chunk this block group represents. Always set
		   to BTRFS_FIRST_CHUNK_TREE_OBJECTID */
        __le64 chunk_objectid;
		/* Various flags, defining the allocation and replication policies */
        __le64 flags;
}

Flags is a bitfield with following bits possible:

Allocation policies:

* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_DATA  - Whether this block group represents data
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_SYSTEM   - Whether this block group represents the system chunk
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_METADATA - Whether this block group represents metadata

Replication policies:

* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_RAID0    - Data in this block group is striped
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_RAID1    - Data in this block group is mirrored
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_DUP      - Data in this block group is duplicated on the same drive
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_RAID10   - Data in this block group is mirrored across striped devices (raid 1 + 0)
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_RAID5    - Data in this block group is in Raid 5 mode
* BTRFS_BLOCK_GROUP_RAID6    - Data in this block group is in Raid 6 mode


FILE EXTENT DATA item
---------------------

Every file in BTRFS is described by any number of file extent data items.
This is similar to how other filesystems describe ranges of file data (e.g.
xfs/ext4). In BTRFS a file extent can be in one of 3 states:

* BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_INLINE - an extent item who can hold all of the actual file
data in its body is considered an inline extent. In such cases data is read
directly from the body of the extent. The current default value is 2048 bytes,
but it can be changed with max_inline mount option. The max_inline value is then
calculated with min(max_inline_value, filesystem block). The default filesystem
block size is the page size.

* BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_PREALLOC - a pre-allocated extent. These are ranges which
have been reserved by using fallocate. Each extent can map up to 256Mb for
pre-allocated extents.

* BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG - regular file extent. Most of the extents of a file
would be regular extents. Those extents hold information necessary to locate
the actual data on disk. Each extent can map up to 128Mb for regular extents.

A file extent data item holds information about a particular logical region of
a file. This is done through the disk_bytenr and disk_num_bytes members. File
holes are represented by having disk_bytenr and disk_num_byte equal 0 and the
abscense of relevant EXTENT ITEMs in the extent tree

Key:
key.type = BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY
key.objectid = inode number of the file this extent describes
key.offset = starting offset within the file

struct btrfs_file_extent_item {
        /*
         * transaction id that created this extent
         */
        __le64 generation;
        /*
         * max number of bytes to hold this extent in ram
         * when we split a compressed extent we can't know how big
         * each of the resulting pieces will be.  So, this is
         * an upper limit on the size of the extent in ram instead of
         * an exact limit.
         */
        __le64 ram_bytes;

		/* Compression type. Can be one of: BTRFS_COMPRESS_NONE,
		 * BTRFS_COMPRESS_ZLIB or BTRFS_COMPRESS_LZO
         */
        __u8 compression;

		/* Encryption type. Currently unused */
        __u8 encryption;

        /* Any other transformation which might have been applied to this extent.
         * Currently unused.
        __le16 other_encoding;

        /* Type of extent: BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_INLINE, BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG,
         * or BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_PREALLOC.
        __u8 type;

		/* The following fields apply only to BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_REG and
         * BTRFS_FILE_EXTENT_PREALLOC.
         */

		/* Logical address of the start of the extent. Note: This is the
         * key.objectid of the corresponding EXTENT_ITEM. If this is an inline
         * extent, then the inline data will start at this point.
         */
        __le64 disk_bytenr;

		/* Number of on-disk bytes of the extent (compressed). Note: This is the
         * key.offset for the corresponding EXTENT_ITEM
         */
        __le64 disk_num_bytes;

        /*
         * the logical offset in file blocks (no csums)
         * this extent record is for.  This allows a file extent to point
         * into the middle of an existing extent on disk, sharing it
         * between two snapshots (useful if some bytes in the middle of the
         * extent have changed
         */
        __le64 offset;

        /*
         * the logical number of file blocks (no csums included).  This
         * always reflects the size uncompressed and without encoding.
         */
        __le64 num_bytes;
}


EXTENT_ITEM
-----------

EXTENT_ITEM items describe the space allocated for metadata tree nodes and
leafs as well as data extents. The space is allocated from block groups that
define the appropriate regions. In addition to functioning as basic allocation
records, EXTENT_ITEM items also contain back references that can be used to
repair the file system or resolve extent ownership back to a set of one or
more file trees. Although EXTENT_ITEM items can be used to describe both DATA
and tree block extents, newer file systems with the skinny metadata feature
enabled at mkfs time, use the distinct METADATA_ITEM items to represent metadata
extents instead. One extent record item exists for each extent allocated on a btrfs
file system. Each item tracks the number of explicit references to the extent,
records whether the extent contains file data or tree metadata and, if the
latter, if the item contains a full back reference. It is followed by back 
reference records for each explicit reference held.

[TODO: Document implied references]

Key:
key.objectid = logical address of the extent
key.type = BTRFS_EXTENT_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = length of extent

struct btrfs_extent_item {
		/* Number of references of this extent */
        __le64 refs;
		/* id of transaction that allocated this extent */
        __le64 generation;

		/* Defines type of data this extent defines, those flags also defined
		 * the type of data which follow this struct.
         */
        __le64 flags;
}

* BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_DATA [0x1] - Flag to indicate that the following record refers
 to a data extent

* BTRFS_EXTENT_FLAG_TREE_BLOCK [0x2] - Flag to indicate that the following record
 refers to a metadata tree block

* BTRFS_BLOCK_FLAG_FULL_BACKREF [0x80] - Tree block back reference contains a
 full back reference.

As stated previously  the btrfs_extent_item is generally followed by multiple
structures, based on the type of the data that the extent holds (metadata or
data). Each backref begins with a btrfs_extent_inline_ref structure:

struct btrfs_extent_inline_ref {
		/* The type of the backref that follows */
        __u8 type;
		/* Dependent on the actual type of backref */
        __le64 offset;
}

Backrefs are destinguished based on :
1. whether they contain data or metadata  (as defined by btrfs_extent_item.flags)
2. whether the extent is shared or not (as defined by btrfs_extent_inline_ref.type)

The type can take the following values:

BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_REF_KEY: For a file data extent that is indirect/normal.
The content of this backref is a btrfs_extent_data_ref strucutre that overlaps
with the btrfs_extent_inline_ref.offset field:

struct btrfs_extent_data_ref {
		/* Subvolume tree id that references the extent */
        __le64 root;
		/* inode number of the file referencing the extent in the given root */
        __le64 objectid;
		/* Byte offset for the extent within the file in case partial
		 * sharing 
		 */
        __le64 offset;
		/* reference count for the extent */
        __le32 count;
}

BTRFS_SHARED_DATA_REF_KEY: For a file data extent that is shared among subvols/
snapshots. The content of this backref is the bytenr of the btree leaf
containing the BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY item for this extent reference. This value
overlays btrfs_extent_inline_ref.offset field. The btrfs_extent_inline_ref is
also followed by the following btrfs_shared_data_ref struct:

struct btrfs_shared_data_ref {
		/* reference count for the extent */
        __le32 count;
}

Ext refs:

In case an extent item doesn't have enough space to store all the references to 
it, the filesystem reverts to storing the so called extref. An extref is an 
additional item which is recorded in the extent tree. The key/item body depend 
on the kind of reference being tracked.

For ordinary data extents it has the following format: 

key.objectid = logical bytenr of the extent being referenced
key.type = BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_REF_KEY
key.offset = crc32c hash of [root, objectid, offset]

Item body is `struct btrfs_extent_data_ref`, see above for detailed info. 

For shared data extents it's: 

key.objectid = logical bytenr of the extent being referenced
key.type = BTRFS_SHARED_DATA_REF_KEY
key.offset = the bytenr of the btree leaf containing the BTRFS_EXTENT_DATA_KEY
item for this extent reference

Item body is `struct btrfs_shared_data_ref`

METADATA extent item
--------------------

METADATA items exist only on filesystem which have enabled "skinny metadata"
feature during mkfs time. They describe the space allocated for metadata tree
nodes and leafs. The space is allocated from block groups that define metadata
regions. In addition to functioning as basic allocation records, METADATA_ITEM
items also contain back references that can be used to repair the file system
or resolve extent ownership back to a set of one or more file trees.

Key:
key.objectid = logical address of start of extent
key.type = BTRFS_METADATA_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = level of block in the btree that contains it

The body composition of the METADATA ITEM is similar to that of the EXTENT_ITEM.
First we have struct btrfs_extent_item, followed by btrfs_extent_inline_ref.
However,  there is a difference in the values stored in the btrfs_extent_inline_ref
for a metadata item as follows:

struct btrfs_extent_inline_ref {
		/* The type of the backref that follows: BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY
		 * or BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY
		 */
        __u8 type;

		/* If type is BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY: contains the logical address
		 * for the parent metadata block.
		 *
		 * If type is BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY: contains the objectid for the
		 * B-tree root.
		 */
        __le64 offset;
}


CHECKSUM ITEM
-------------

BTRFS (unless otherwise) instructed checksums every 4kb of every file written.
Those checksums are stored in checksum items. All the checksum items key have
identical values for their objectid and type fields, the only way to
destinguish them is via their offset. It describes the starting offset on disk
for which the checksum were calculated. Currently all checksums are CRC32C
number and are 4 bytes, but this might change in the future. Knowing this the
end of the byte range which this csum item described can be derived with the
following equations:

file item size / 4 = number of checksums
offset + (number of checksums * 4096) = end logical address

For example if we have an offset of 50000, then the first checksum in this item
would be for logical address 50000, the next one will be for logical address
54096, the one after that for 58192 and so on.

This way it's possible to find the checksum for any piece of data in a file by
simply finding such a csum item whose [start, end] ofsets contain the
[disk_bytenr, disk_bytenr + disk_num_bytes] for the respective file extent.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_EXTENT_CSUM_OBJECTID
key.type = BTRFS_EXTENT_CSUM_KEY
key.offset = starting logical disk address of the checksummed region

struct btrfs_csum_item {
	/* Start of a variable length sequence of checksum */
	__u8 csum;
}


FREE SPACE INFO item (v2 cache only)
------------------------------------

Each block group is represented in the free space tree by a free space info
item that stores accounting information: whether the free space for this block
group is stored as bitmaps or extents and how many extents of free space exist
for this block group (regardless of which format is being used in the tree).

key.objectid = key.objectid of the block group this item represents (e.g. starting
logical address of said group)
key.type = BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_INFO_KEY
key.offset = key.offset of the block group this item represents (e.g. size of the
block group)

struct btrfs_free_space_info {
		/* Number of free extents in this block group */
       __le32 extent_count;
	   /* flags, currently only BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_USING_BITMAPS */
       __le32 flags;
}


FREE SPACE EXTENT item (v2 cache only)
--------------------------------------

When prudent, the actual freespace in the freespace tree is described with
keys, that do not have any associated data with them i.e. plain key strucutre.
They contains the start/end of the freespace extent.

key.objectid = start address of free space
key.type = BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_EXTENT_KEY
key.offset = length of this extent


FREE SPACE BITMAP item (v2 cache only)
--------------------------------------

When a blockgroup becomes very fragmented it might be more space-efficient to
store the free space information in free space bitmap items. Those items
consist of a key and their associated data is just an array of bytes. Each bit
in the bitmap represents the state of a single sectorsize worth of data.

key.objectid = starting address of the region this item describes
key.type = BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_BITMAP_KEY
key.offset = length of the region described by this item


FREE SPACE HEADER (v1 cache only)
---------------------------------

The old (pre-freespace btree) free space cache uses free space header item to
as a descriptor for a free space. Its contents consist of a
btrfs_free_space_header struct.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_OBJECTID
key.type = 0
key.offset = objectid (i.e. starting logical address) of the block group
this free space header describes

struct btrfs_free_space_header {
		/* disk key of free space inode */
        struct btrfs_disk_key location;
        __le64 generation;
		/* Number of entries in the free space file */
        __le64 num_entries;
        __le64 num_bitmaps;
}

The contents of the freespace file have the following layout

<CRC PAGE><EXTENTS><BITMAPS>

CRC page holds the crc for extents and bitmaps. The format of those two is
described by the following structure:

struct btrfs_free_space_entry {
		/* Logical address of start of free space */
        __le64 offset;
		/* Length in bytes */
        __le64 bytes;
		/* Whether it's BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_BITMAP or BTRFS_FREE_SPACE_EXTENT */
        __u8 type;
}


DIR item
--------

Dir items are used for both standard user-visible directories and internal
directories, used to manage named extended attributes. For every visible name
in a filesystem there is a corresponding DIR item. This item is also used to
house the XATTR for a file, in this case there is one DIR item for every xattr
attribute.

Key:
key.objectid = inode of directory containing this entry
key.type = BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY | BTRFS_XATTR_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = crc32c name hash of either the direntry name (user visible) or the name
of the extended attribute name


struct btrfs_dir_item {
		/* In case of ordinary direntry it holds the inode key it applies to,
		 * in the xattr case it's zeroed out
		 */
        struct btrfs_disk_key location;
		/* Id of transaction which modified this dir entry */
        __le64 transid;
		/* Length of XATTR value, 0 otherwise */
        __le16 data_len;
		/* Length of either the name of the XATTR or the length of the dir entry*/
        __le16 name_len;
		/* BTRFS_FT_XATTR if XATTR otherwise signals the type of the inode */
        __u8 type;

		/* In case of an ordinary dir entry then the name string will come after
	     * the type. In case of an XATTR then first comes the xattr name, followed
		 * by the xattr value
	     */
}

In case the dir item doesn't describe an XATTR, type can be one of:

* BTRFS_FT_REG_FILE - Indicates a regular file.
* BTRFS_FT_DIR - The target object is a directory
* BTRFS_FT_CHRDEV - The target object is an INODE_ITEM representing a character device node.
* BTRFS_FT_BLKDEV - The target object is an INODE_ITEM representing a block device node.
* BTRFS_FT_FIFO - The target object is an INODE_ITEM representing a FIFO device node.
* BTRFS_FT_SOCK - The target object is an INODE_ITEM representing a socket device node.
* BTRFS_FT_SYMLINK - The target object is an INODE_ITEM representing a symbolic link.


DIR INDEX item
--------------

Dir index items are used when looking up entries in a directory. Their data
portion is identical to that of the DIR item. The only difference is in the
key used to lookup the item. This duplication is necessary to ensure good
readdir perfromance. Since readdir requires monotonicaly incrementing indices,
the key's offset field is modified to contain a counter, which is incremented
everytime a new entry appears in a directory.

Key:
key.objectid = inode number of directory we are looking up into
key.type = BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY
key.offset = index id in the directory. Indices start at 2 (due to '.' and '..)


INODE REF item
--------------

This item stores a reference to the parent directory for a file. It's a
reliability aide which allows the file system to find out the parent directory
of a recovered file. There is one such item per file in the filesystem.
Additionally it also stores all hardlink to the file in a btrfs_inode_ref
structure. Files with hard links in multiple directories have multiple
reference items, one for each parent directory. Files with multiple hard links
in the same directory pack all of the links' filenames into the same reference
item.

Key:
key.objectid = inode number of file
key.type = BTRFS_INODE_REF_KEY
key.offset = inode number of parent of file

struct btrfs_inode_ref {
		/* Index in the parent directory of this hardlink, given by key.offset */
        __le64 index;

		/* Length of string, coming right after this member */
        __le16 name_len;

        /* Variable length, non-null terminated string of length 'name_len' */
}


EXTENDED INODE REF item
-----------------------

The total number of inode refs that a given inode number / parent inode number
tuple can have is limited by our leaf size. Unfortunately this limits the
maximum number of hardlinks we can have. Extended inode refs fix this
limitation by using a key offset that's a hash of the link name and parent
inode number. Extended refs don't replace the existing ref array. An inode
gets an extended ref for a given link only after the ref array has been
filled.

Key:
key.objectid = inode number of file
key.type = BTRFS_INODE_EXTREF_KEY
key.offset = hash of link name and parent inode number

struct btrfs_inode_extref {
       /* Inode number of parent directory */
       __le64 parent_objectid;

	/* Index in the parent directory of this hardlink */
	__le64 index;

	/* Length of string, coming right after this member */
	__le16 name_len;

	/* Variable length, non-null terminated string of length 'name_len' */
	__u8   name[0];
} __attribute__ ((__packed__));


QGROUP STATUS item
------------------

Used to hold information about the qgroup states for a particular subvolume.
This implies there is one such item for every qgroup tree.

Key:
key.objectid = 0
key.type = BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_KEY
key.offset = 0

truct btrfs_qgroup_status_item {
		/* Version of the qgroup subsystem, currently set to BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_VERSION (1)
        __le64 version;

        /*
         * the generation is updated during every commit. As older
         * versions of btrfs are not aware of qgroups, it will be
         * possible to detect inconsistencies by checking the
         * generation on mount time
         */
        __le64 generation;

        /* flag definitions */
        __le64 flags;

        /*
         * only used during scanning to record the progress
         * of the scan. It contains a logical address
         */
        __le64 rescan;
}

* BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_ON [0x1] - Subvolume quota turned on.
* BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_RESCAN [0x2] - Signals whether rescan is in progress.
* BTRFS_QGROUP_STATUS_FLAG_INCONSISTENT [0x4] - Turned on when some qgroup
  entries are known to be out of date, either because the configuration has
  changed in a certain way that requires rescan or because the fs has been
  mounted with a non-qgroup-aware version.  Turning qouta off and on again
  makes it inconsistent, too.


QGROUP INFO item
----------------

Items of this type are used to track the amount of space used by a particular
subvolume. There is one such item per subvolume.

TODO: Expand a bit on exclusive VS referenced bytes


Key:
key.objectid = 0
key.type = BTRFS_QGROUP_INFO_KEY
key.offste = id of qgroup (the same as the objectid of the subvolume this qgroup
accounts).


struct btrfs_qgroup_info_item {
		/* Id of transaction when this item was created */
        __le64 generation;
		/* Referenced bytes (including shared data) */
        __le64 rfer;
		/* Referenced bytes compressed */
        __le64 rfer_cmpr;
		/* Exclusive bytes (i.e. bytes not being shared by a subvolume */
        __le64 excl;
		/* Exlucisve bytes compressed */
        __le64 excl_cmpr;
}


QGROUP LIMIT item
-----------------

Configured qgroup limits are persisted on disk by the QGROUP limit items. When
some data is to be written on disk the usage space in QGROUP INFO items are
checked against the limits in QGROUP LIMIT items.

Key:
key.objectid = 0
key.type = BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_KEY
key.offset = id of qgroup (the same as the objectid of the subvolume this qgroup
limits)

struct btrfs_qgroup_limit_item {
		/* Contains information about enabled limits. */
        __le64 flags;
		/* Maximum referenced bytes (including shared data) */
        __le64 max_rfer;
		/* Maximum exclusive bytes */
        __le64 max_excl;
		/* Unused */
        __le64 rsv_rfer;
		/* Unused */
        __le64 rsv_excl;
}

Flags:

* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_MAX_RFER [0x1] Limit on maximum referenced data enabled
* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_MAX_EXCL [0x2] Limit on maximum eclusive data enabled
* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_RSV_RFER [0x4] Unused
* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_RSV_EXCL [0x8] Unused
* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_RFER_CMPR [0x10] (Unused) Limit on maximum compressed referenced data enabled
* BTRFS_QGROUP_LIMIT_EXCL_CMPR [0x20] (Unused) Limit on maximum exclusive compressed data size enabled


QGROUP RELATION item
--------------------

Qgroup relation items are used to record a parent<=>child relantionship in the
quota tree. Those items are also created in pairs. In order to distinguish
child from parents a numerical comparison needs to be performed of .objectid
and .offset. The key assumption is that child qgroups (which inherit the id of
the subvolume they represent) will have increasing objectids. Those items have
no body, only a key.

Key:
key.objectid = parent qgroup
key.type = BTRFS_QGROUP_RELATION_KEY
key.offset = child qgroup


ORPHAN item
-----------

ORPHAN items are used to track inodes which are being deleted/truncated. They
are added to the filesystem root of an inode at the beginning of a delete or
truncate operation. This ensures that in case of a crash during a complex i
operation the filesystem will be able to recognise that this inode is likely
to have garbage content and will clean it up. This item doesn't have a body
but the key is used to only store the orphaned inode number.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_ORPHAN_OBJECTID
key.type = BTRFS_ORPHAN_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = inode number


DIR LOG item
------------

TODO: Explain what exactly this item logs and how the key type varies and how
it's supposed to be used in the context of tree logging.

Key:
key.objectid = inode number of the directory
key.type = BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY or BTRFS_DIR_LOG_INDEX_KEY (Todo: Depends on what ? )
key.offset = first offset (TODO: What exactly is it? )

struct btrfs_dir_log_item {
		/* End of range [key.offset, end] */
        __le64 end;
}


BALANCE item
------------

BALANCE item is inserted when a balancing operation commences. Its purpose is
to enable balancing to continue in case a crash occurs. It stores the
parameters passed from userspace via the ioctl interface.

Key:
key.objectid = BTRFS_BALANCE_OBJECTID
key.type = BTRFS_TEMPORARY_ITEM_KEY
key.offset = 0

struct btrfs_balance_item {
        /* BTRFS_BALANCE_* */
        __le64 flags;

        struct btrfs_disk_balance_args meta;
		/* Options for SYSTEM chunks */
        struct btrfs_disk_balance_args sys;

        __le64 unused[4];
}

struct btrfs_disk_balance_args {
        /*
         * profiles to operate on, single is denoted by
         * BTRFS_AVAIL_ALLOC_BIT_SINGLE

        __le64 profiles;

        /*
         * usage filter
         * BTRFS_BALANCE_ARGS_USAGE with a single value means '0..N'

         */
        union {
                __le64 usage;
                struct {
                        __le32 usage_min;
                        __le32 usage_max;
                };
        };

        /* devid filter */
        __le64 devid;

        /* devid subset filter [pstart..pend) */
        __le64 pstart;
        __le64 pend;

        union {

                struct {
                        __le32 limit_min;

        __le32 stripes_min;
        __le32 stripes_max;

        __le64 unused[6];
}

UUID item
----------------

For every created subvolume/snapshot an item is inserted into the UUID tree.
This items is used to map from uuid to subvolume id. 

Key:
key.objectid = first half of UUID 
key.type = UUID_KEY_SUBVOL  or UUID_KEY_RECEIVED_SUBVOL
key.offset = second half of UUID 

The body of the items consists of an array of one or more (but typically one) 
subvolume id.  For subvolumes the key's type field has a value of UUID_KEY_SUBVOL. 
When a subvolume is received it creates both a UUID_KEY_RECEIVED_SUBVOL and 
UUID_KEY_SUBVOL items with the same subvol_id body.
