Delayed inodes
==============

The delayed inodes are a mechanims to avoid unnecessary IO and metadata
updates regarding file creation and deletion.  The operations are first
performed only in memory, and when the transaction commits, the respective
metadata structures are created.  This can help in situations where many
temporary files are created and deleted in quick succession.

Filesystem operations like readdir need to check the delayed lists first, but
not all operations on an inode are implemented as delayed.  The following
operations are boosted via delayed operations:

* Modification of INODE_ITEM
* Removal of INODE_REF item
* Directory index


Modification of INODE_ITEM
--------------------------

There are quite a lot of operations that a filesystem performs which modify
the state of the in-memory copy of struct inode. In turn those modification
should eventually be synced to disk to keep the filesystem consistent. In
BTRFS the function which performs this syncing between the generic inode and
the internal representation of an inode (INODE_ITEM) is called
btrfs_update_inode.  Everytime we want to sync the state to an INODE_ITEM  a
call to btrfs_delayed_update_inode is performed which captures current state
in an in-memory btrfs_inode_item and also reserves enough space for writing
this item on-disk during transaction commit. It's important to note that there
are certain conditions which would prevent the delayed modification of an
inode, namely:

* in case the inode is a free space inode (hidden from ordinary users) then
we don't update it via the delayed-inode mechanism

* in case we are performing log recovery (BTRFS_FS_LOG_RECOVERING flag is set)
delayed updates are also skipped, since they can lead to a deadlock

* inodes, part of the relocation tree are also skipped.


Removal of INODE_REF item
-------------------------

In case we have single-link inodes (i.e. they have no hard-links) the delayed
inode can exploit the fact that INODE_REF is inserted at the same as the
INODE_ITEM. So during unlink we can check if the condition is met and if so
just call btrfs_delayed_delete_inode_ref() to signal we'd like to remove the
inode ref.


Directory index
---------------

Everytime an entry is added to a directory btrfs creates 2 items. One is the
DIR which represents the entry in the directory. It also creates a duplicate
DIR INDEX item which is used by readdir.  Thanks to delayed inode btrfs is
able to delay the insertion of the DIR_INDEX item until transaction commit. In
the mean time in addition to querying the btree for dir items, btrfs'
implementation of readdir also enumerates the entries in the delayed inode
tree.

Implementation
==============

Overview
--------

The implementation relies on a delayed root object into the file system, that
uses two lists to manage delayed nodes. There is one delayed node coresponding
to every directory/file created in the filesystem. Delayed nodes are anchored
in the delayed root by 2 lists - prepare_list and node_list. Items on the
former list are only processed by the async worker, that's invoked when
certain thresholds are crossed. The nodes on the latter are processed when
either btrfs_run_delayed_items or btrfs_run_delayed_items_nr is called.


Delayed node
------------

Inode updates are managed by the btrfs_delayed_update_inode function, it
sets the BTRFS_DELAYED_NODE_INODE_DIRTY flag, meaning this delayed node has
dirty inode data and needs to be comitted on-disk during next processing cycle
of this delayed node.

Inode ref deletion is faciliated by the btrfs_delayed_delete_inode_ref function,
it also uses a flag (BTRFS_DELAYED_NODE_DEL_IREF) signalling the need to delete
the inode ref item.

For readdir the implementation is easy. Each delayed node stores the index
items to be inserted in a rb-tree, indexed by the btrfs_key of the respective
item. So during readdir enumeration in addition to consulting the on-disk btree,
the code will also consult the pending items for insertion. Similarly, when
a directory index item has been slated for deletion the readdir code will check
to see if any of the on-disk items are also present in the to-be-deleted rb-tree,
in this case it will just skip them. The list of items is being managed by
btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index for items to be inserted and btrfs_delete_delayed_dir_index
