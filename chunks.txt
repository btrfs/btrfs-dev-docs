Introduction
=============

Btrfs uses the concepts of chunks in order to implement its logical space. This
space is linear and is overlaid atop the physical storage. This allows to 
incorporate volume manager functionality in the filesystem. To fully understand 
how various RAID modes are implements it's important to understand how this 
logical spaces relates to physical blocks on disk. 

BTRFS splits the logical space into 3 types of chunks. Each distinct
type is used for particular type of allocation. DATA chunks are used for
storing data, METADATA for storing metadata and SYSTEM for storing some of the 
critical trees of the filesystem. Each of those chunk types can have different 
raid characteristics, for example a filesystem can have a RAID1 metadata, meaning 
there will be 2 copies of every metadata on 2 disks and SINGLE data i.e only a 
single copy of the actual data. 

Chunks are allocated on demand throughout the life of the filesystem and their 
utilization will be dependent on the type of workload being used. For example a
moderately large filesystem can use a lot of metadata space if it uses plenty 
of snapshots, since every snapshot adds metadata overhead. 

Each chunk consists of one or more device extents. A device extent is a 
contiguous physical space which is allocated for a particular allocation type (
metadata/data/system as described above). As a concrete example consider 
having a filesystem which has metadata stored as raid1. In the chunk tree it 
looks like: 

item 3 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 4593811456) itemoff 15863 itemsize 112
		length 268435456 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type METADATA|RAID1
		io_align 65536 io_width 65536 sector_size 4096
		num_stripes 2 sub_stripes 1
			stripe 0 devid 2 offset 2425356288
			dev_uuid a7963b67-1277-49ff-bb1d-9d81c5605f1b
			stripe 1 devid 1 offset 2446327808
			dev_uuid 5f8b54f0-2a35-4330-a06b-9c8fd935bc36

Here we see we have a metadata chunk, whose logical size is 256m but its physical 
size is really 512 mb. Because the logical 256mb will consist of 2 physical 
stripes, one on each device comprising the filesystem. Another example would be
RAID0: 

item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2446327808) itemoff 15975 itemsize 112
		length 2147483648 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|RAID0
		io_align 65536 io_width 65536 sector_size 4096
		num_stripes 2 sub_stripes 1
			stripe 0 devid 2 offset 1351614464
			dev_uuid a7963b67-1277-49ff-bb1d-9d81c5605f1b
			stripe 1 devid 1 offset 1372585984
			dev_uuid 5f8b54f0-2a35-4330-a06b-9c8fd935bc36

Here we have a logical data chunk that's 2gb in size and each physical stripe 
is 1g. That's because in RAID0 mode btrfs splits writes across 2 disks. Usually 
to calculate the length of a physical extent one has to divide the logical 
chunk size by the number of stripes. Notable exception is raid1 since data 
is mirrored there. 

Translating physical to logical addresses
=========================================

Various functions inside btrfs translate between logical and physical addresses. 
To understand how this is done it's important to understand the parlance of 
btrfs' code. Let's work out through an example. 

Consider we want to write 2m at at 4596957184 - that's 3m past the start of 
the data chunk in the previous example. In order to see where in the physical 
stripe this write will go into we need to derive the following values: 

block group offset = [address within block group] -  [start address of block group]
block_group_offset = 4596957184 - 4593811456 = 3145728 => 3m

Btrfs actually uses the word "stripe" for 2 different types of stripe. The first
is the already introduced physical stripe. The second type stripe is the logical
stripe. Logical stripe is the granularity at which writes are mapped in btrfs, 
that's generally io_width which is currently hard-coded at 64k. To calculate 
the logical stripe the block_group_offset is divided by logical stripe size : 

logical_stripe = [block group offset ] / [logical stripe size]
logical_stripe = 3145728 / 64k = 48

Aimed  with those 2 variables it's possible to calculate the physical address
by: 

physical_address = [physical stripe start] + [logical_stripe] * [logical stripe_size]
physical_address = 1351614464 + 48 * 64k = 1351614464 + 3145728 = 1354760192

So logical address 4596957184 corresponds to physical address 1354760192 for 
that particular device. For the other chunk since the base address is different 
naturally the end result is also going to be different.

The important thing to consider is "stripe" refers to more than one thing in 
btrfs parlance, namely it could refer to a physical stripe - the physical chunk, 
which constitutes a logical one or the "logical stripe" which is the write
granularity of btrfs.
